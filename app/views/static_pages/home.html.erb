<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Use the Yelp API to make a table that displays the top <%=@response.businesses.count%> results for a search for '<%= @parameters[:term] %>' in Salt Lake City, UT. </p>
</br>
<p>Navigating the Yelp API is straightforward, but there are some speed bumps for the uninitiated!</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are using Rails, clone the <%= link_to 'sample Yelp app', 'https://github.com/Yelp/yelp-rails-example' %>
    <ul>
      <li>The sample is pretty light, it did not help me figure out how to display the data on my page. That was the biggest hurdle I faced... I will link to how I set everything up, along with examples of how to display the data soon! For now, you can view this app on <%= link_to 'GitHub', 'https://github.com/AmandaWalter/API_practice_app' %></li></ul></li>
  <li>Next steps:
    <ul>
      <li>User can define their own search term and location</li>
      <li>Each address links to directions to the business</li>
      <li>Testing!</li>
      <li>All locations populate on a map</li>
      <li>Do something cool with the Instagram API</li>
  </li>

  </ul>
<p><strong>Clicking a business name will take you to the business' Yelp profile.</strong></br>The businesses are sorted</p>

  <% @response.businesses.each do |business| %>
    <tr>
      <td><%=link_to business.name, business.url%></td>

      <td><%=business.location.display_address%></td>
